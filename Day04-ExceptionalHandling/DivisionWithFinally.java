/*finally Block Execution
ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement:
Write a program that performs integer division and demonstrates the finally block execution.
The program should:
Take two integers from the user.
Perform division.
Handle ArithmeticException (if dividing by zero).
Ensure "Operation completed" is always printed using finally.
Expected Behavior:
If valid, print the result.
If an exception occurs, handle it and still print "Operation completed".
